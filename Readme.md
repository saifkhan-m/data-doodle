## Data Engineering Challenge- Doodle
The challenge represents a problem where we have to create an application that process a stream of data.

I have used Pyhton as my lanaguage of choice as I have not used JAVA in some time and therefore more comfortable in python.
####
Libraries used are mentioned in this requirement file.
